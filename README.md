# Gig-Economy-Analysis-with-Tableau
A Data-Driven Exploration of Freelancer Earnings, Performance &amp; Market Trends

## Project Overview

This Tableau project provides a comprehensive analysis of 1,950 freelancers across multiple gig platforms, examining trends in earnings, job success, hourly rates, rehire patterns, and more. By integrating two key datasetsâ€”freelancer profiles and job performance metricsâ€”I created **interactive dashboards** that answer strategic business questions for both freelancers and platform operators.

## Business Background

The gig economy is transforming how work is doneâ€”freelancers are now central to project delivery across industries. However, predicting earnings, success rates, and identifying in-demand skills remains a challenge.

FreelanceGig Analytics aims to bridge this gap using data. With this project, I analyzed:
- Earning trends by category and platform
- Job success and client rating metrics
- Hourly rate benchmarks by experience level
- Rehire rate as an indicator of trust and loyalty
- Forecasted earnings to guide freelancersâ€™ future decisions

## Problem Statement

Despite rapid gig economy growth, freelancers and clients struggle to:
- Identify profitable niches and platforms
- Understand how experience impacts earnings
- Evaluate freelancer reliability
- Predict income for planning purposes

This project addresses those issues using **Tableau-powered dashboards** and **descriptive statistics**.
